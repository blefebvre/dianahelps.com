                <h3>About</h3>

                <p>
                    Welcome! I have over 10 years of experience counselling individuals and leading group therapy
                    in a variety of contexts. My work as a Registered Psychotherapist is client centered, and
                    incorporates physical and psychosocial education to help clients toward their goals. I have a
                    PhD in Educational Counselling from the University of Ottawa, where I studied psychotherapy
                    processes and researched eating disorder treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond counselling work, I try to laugh with my husband, grow with our children, like the idea
                    of staying fit, read to better understand our world, and get cranky when I'm hungry or tired.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I like helping individuals navigate personal and professional development. I seek to recognize
                    the needs of students and support adults as they care for themselves and
                    their loved ones. I have extensive experience in sport and working with athletes. Whatever the
                    challenge, I use evidence-based treatments to understand the past, find purpose in the present,
                    and encourage growth moving forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My clinical work is supervised by Dr. Barbara Virley, Registered Psychologist.

                <p>
                    Counselling fees are consistent with rates for my expertise. Fees are not covered under OHIP,
                    but may be reimbursed by extended health care plans. Please check with your insurance
                    provider to determine the extent of coverage provided.
